siddharthck: You are a software engineer and write production ready chrome extension. you are going to develop the plugin "Assistant to the Assistant". 

Problem you will be solving : 
SJSU library media services student assistntas struggle to get a jist of the todays events, if they need hybrid suport (set up camera and audio in advance) or just a normal even which involves projectors and microphones. and tha is because event space calender is complex to navigate. they have to click back and forth to get how they have to manage today;s tasks. especially if a note is written by supervisor in event details which can be missed. and this is because a student assistant is only concerned about the events which are during the his/her shift. there is too much clutter. There are even rooms which are of no concern to the user. they just need to care about subset of rooms.

How you will solve this problem ? 

We have to present a dashbord to student assistant which is going to be interactive. we can have a tiles on dashboard : displaying the room name, reservation start end, actula event start end time, a badge where it indicates its a hybrid/ simple setup, and an icon if there are internal notes by anyone. 

and if you click on this tile, we should get detailed view of the event lets say in a pupup. which will have all the event information.


What data we need ? 

1. user's data to get the today's time window for which we will  filter out the events to display on dashboard OR just a custom time window entered by user

this data must be typically kept in local storage in json format. 

 -- how to get this data : when there is no file lete data : assistant_to_assistant_user_settings.json found locally or there are no weekly shifts record present, we need an input settings form page : which will be a form taking following inputs : 
  A. user name
  b. Email
  C. weekly shift calender monday - sunday and keep in mind that a student can have multiple shifts during a day so you need to have a button add another time slot for the day (we need to take inouts fot the day in terms of from and to hrs:min use a time picker) 
    so this is how final user_settings.json will look like :  
{name : "john Doe", emaill : "", description: "",
shifts : {"monday" : { "8:00-13:00", "14:30-18:00"}, "tuesday" : {...}, ....,
"preferred_spaces" : ["225","255",], user_creation_time : "ISO", "settings_last_update_time" : "ISO"
}



  D. rooms of concern : 
  for user form we should have a checkbox for all the rooms with some of the rooms check box already checked arranged all the room check boxes in some categories. this rooms data is in rooms.json whilch will have somethig that looks like  : 

  {
"Public Meeting Rooms" : {"group_id":"10165",  "rooms" : [{"id" : , "name" : , "description" : ".." },{...}, ... ],
"tech_spaces" : {}..
"dhc" : ...,
"classrooms_floor_2" : ...
"classrooms_floor_5": .. ,
"rooms_of_concern" : ["255", "225", .....]
}

    if user ticks/unticks the current chekboxes or other additional checkboxes, we should update the list "rooms_of_concern" json array.

 if lets say a user should be able to update the settings for room ttings email and shedule as well updating corresponding json files. 

 if user does not want to enter any data and just want to look for the dashboard for a specific day, we need input of the day and a time range from-to hrs:mins. We want to give a button on nav-bar on all pages which takes to the see dashboard for custom date and time range on all pages. such that even without user data/settings we can display the custom dashboard. for this we will need to still ask the rooms of concern with defult checked rooms from rooms.json.





2. actual event data

this is the data on which we will apply filters on to display the dashboard. for a time range based on user settings  or custom range, we will need to filter the events. we have an event list which looks like:

[
        {
        "bookId": "cs_rAvGAZFO",
        "id": 87208149,
        "status": 4,
        "start": "2025-04-27 13:00:00",
        "end": "2025-04-27 18:00:00",
        "item": "225",
        "seat": "",
        "group": "Public Meeting Rooms",
        "location": "King Library Public Meeting Rooms",
        "nickname": "BLOCK: Wayne\u0027s Exhibit",
        "email": "estella.inda@sjsu.edu",
        "firstName": "Estella",
        "lastName": "Inda",
        "phoneNumber": "",
        "barcode": "",
        "event": null
    }, .....

]

This data is get by making a HTTPs req. and we have to make request for every group: for example group here is Public Meeting Rooms. to get the list from all groups. these groups are provided in rooms.json. look at "item" in the data this is our rooms["name"] in rooms.json.


for every booking in our lists, we have to make a https req to get the details of the booking. (which is an html document): this document contains all the information about the event such as reservation start time- end time,  actual event start and end time, if they require a hybrid meeting setup, devices they have asked for, and also any internal notes by supervisor . so this will be our event object which will hold all the data. however, on the dashboard tiles, we just need to show the specific data and label and badges. upon clicking the tile of a particular booking, we shall display a detialed view on the popup. 


    how do we get this data number 2 actual event data ? 
     to be clear, we should be able to launch this plugin only when we are on the website : https://booking.sjlibrary.org/ . and user must be logged in. other wise we will show a message: please login to the libcal.

     libcal uses sso for authentication. and there are particularly two types of requests we want to make: 
     A : to query the event list for all the event space group such as "Public Meeting Rooms" you will get this information from rooms.json. and a group has a group_id which will be used to query event list. and we can also use query parameter for time range. 

     here is how this req looks like : 
     Request URL:
https://booking.sjlibrary.org/admin/spaces/confirmed/list

this will get us the event list. we get all the lists for timerange for all the event space group.

now we need to make a list of an actual event objects list. which we will get one by one by calling https req for each bookId we have got. and the req looks like this :

with every req we make, we make an event objects list locally for us. this is the list of objects we will use to build our dashboard page. I am attachign a file, we have to do some html-scraping to this kind of file in order to make an appropriate event-object stored in-memory. 

you will have to figure out how we will make these http requests and which type of auth to use and stuff.

I will give a detail about user's flow and UI :

you can use reactjs and make ui components. 

1. Nav bar : should have buttons for 
    A . update settings,  -> when clicked take to user_settings form which will update user_settings.json and rooms.json
    B . view custome date -> when clicked take to custom dashboard form 

2. landing page : 
   check user settings file exists and complete . if not ask for a user_settings form which is mentioned above. 
   submit button which will store/ update existing local storage file user_settings.json

   rooms_setting check box forms: use rooms.json and update local file accordingly with a submit button.

   and a button "take me to the dashboard" which will take user to the dashboard page. we want to pass a time range while calling dashbaord page . this time range would be current day and hr:min from to rannge calculated with help of shift timings.

3. dashboard page : 
    we should display loading screen untill we are making http calls to build our main event object list. 

    once we have our list, we can show the tiles of events categorized in differnt section. Hybrid, normal, requires minimal attention.

    the event_category field in our event has this value. 

    and if we click on the tile, we should be able to see all the event details.
4. custom dashboard input page :
 we will take a day picker and time range hr:min to hr:min, along with a button show custom dashboard. which will take to the dashboard page previously mentioned with custom timerange .

GitHub Copilot: To develop the "Assistant to the Assistant" Chrome extension, we will break the implementation into the following steps:

---

### **1. Project Setup**
- Use **React.js** for the frontend UI.
- Use **localStorage** for storing user settings (`user_settings.json`) and room configurations (`rooms.json`).
- Use **HTML scraping** and **AJAX requests** to fetch event data from the library's website.
- Use **Chrome Extension APIs** to inject the dashboard into the library's website.

---

### **2. Chrome Extension Structure**
The Chrome extension will have the following structure:
```
assistant-to-the-assistant/
├── manifest.json
├── background.js
├── content.js
├── popup/
│   ├── popup.html
│   ├── popup.js
│   └── popup.css
├── dashboard/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Navbar.js
│   │   ├── Dashboard.js
│   │   ├── EventTile.js
│   │   ├── SettingsForm.js
│   │   └── CustomDashboardForm.js
│   └── styles.css
├── utils/
│   ├── api.js
│   ├── scraper.js
│   └── storage.js
└── assets/
    └── icons/
```

---

### **3. Key Features**
#### **A. Navbar**
- Buttons:
  - **Update Settings**: Opens the `SettingsForm` component to update user settings and room preferences.
  - **View Custom Date**: Opens the `CustomDashboardForm` component to input a custom date and time range.

#### **B. Landing Page**
- Check if `user_settings.json` exists in `localStorage`:
  - If not, display the `SettingsForm` to collect user data.
  - If it exists, display a "Take me to the Dashboard" button.

#### **C. Dashboard Page**
- **Loading Screen**: Display a spinner while fetching event data.
- **Event Tiles**:
  - Categorized into **Hybrid**, **Normal**, and **Minimal Attention**.
  - Each tile displays:
    - Room name
    - Reservation start and end time
    - Event start and end time
    - Badges for hybrid/simple setup
    - Icon for internal notes
  - Clicking a tile opens a popup with detailed event information.

#### **D. Custom Dashboard Input Page**
- Form to input:
  - Date picker
  - Time range (from-to)
  - Room preferences (checkboxes)
- Button to "Show Custom Dashboard".

---

### **4. Data Handling**
#### **A. User Settings**
- Stored in `user_settings.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "description": "",
    "shifts": {
      "monday": ["08:00-13:00", "14:30-18:00"],
      "tuesday": ["09:00-12:00"]
    },
    "preferred_spaces": ["225", "255"],
    "user_creation_time": "2025-05-12T10:00:00Z",
    "settings_last_update_time": "2025-05-12T10:00:00Z"
  }
  ```

#### **B. Rooms Configuration**
- Stored in `rooms.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "Public Meeting Rooms": {
      "group_id": "10165",
      "rooms": [
        { "id": "225", "name": "Room 225", "description": "Large meeting room" },
        { "id": "255", "name": "Room 255", "description": "Small meeting room" }
      ]
    },
    "rooms_of_concern": ["225", "255"]
  }
  ```

#### **C. Event Data**
- Fetched via AJAX requests:
  - **Event List**: `/admin/spaces/confirmed/list`
  - **Event Details**: `/admin/equipment/ajax/viewbooking/panel`
- Parsed into an `event` object:
  ```json
  {
    "bookId": "cs_rAvGAZFO",
    "id": 87208149,
    "status": 4,
    "start": "2025-04-27T13:00:00Z",
    "end": "2025-04-27T18:00:00Z",
    "room": "225",
    "nickname": "BLOCK: Wayne's Exhibit",
    "email": "estella.inda@sjsu.edu",
    "event_category": "Hybrid",
    "internal_notes": "Requesting theater for 75 with catering"
  }
  ```

---

### **5. Implementation Plan**
#### **A. Backend Logic**
1. **API Requests**:
   - Use `fetch` or `axios` to make POST and GET requests.
   - Handle authentication via cookies (SSO).
2. **HTML Scraping**:
   - Parse event details from the HTML response using DOMParser.

#### **B. Frontend Components**
1. **SettingsForm**:
   - Form to input user details, weekly shifts, and room preferences.
   - Updates `user_settings.json` and `rooms.json`.
2. **Dashboard**:
   - Fetches and displays event tiles.
   - Categorizes events based on `event_category`.
3. **EventTile**:
   - Displays summarized event details.
   - Opens a popup with detailed information on click.
4. **CustomDashboardForm**:
   - Form to input a custom date and time range.

#### **C. Chrome Extension**
1. **Manifest.json**:
   - Define permissions for `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/`.
   - Inject `content.js` into the library's website.
2. **Content Script**:
   - Inject the dashboard UI into the website.
   - Handle communication between the extension and the webpage.

---

### **6. Next Steps**
1. Set up the project structure.
2. Implement the `SettingsForm` and `rooms.json` handling.
3. Develop the `Dashboard` and `EventTile` components.
4. Integrate API requests and HTML scraping.
5. Test the extension on `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/`.

siddharthck: while making the call fetch event list : we need following in the form data : 
lid=10165&eids%5B%5D=71621&eids%5B%5D=71622&start=2025-05-11&end=2025-05-18&daily=false lid: is group_id from the rooms.

Made changes.

The `fetchEventList` function has been updated to include the required form data parameters: `lid`, `eids[]`, `start`, `end`, and `daily`. Let me know if you need further adjustments or additional features!

siddharthck: index.js:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module (at index.js:1:1)

GitHub Copilot: This error occurs because the browser does not recognize ES6 `import` statements unless the script is explicitly marked as a module. To fix this, you need to update the `<script>` tag in the `index.html` file to include the `type="module"` attribute.

Let me update the `index.html` file for you. 
````

````


Made changes.

The `index.html` file has been updated to include the `type="module"` attribute in the `<script>` tag for index.js. This should resolve the issue with the `import` statement. Let me know if you encounter any further problems!

siddharthck: Assistant to the Assistant installed.
index.js:5 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'

GitHub Copilot: The error `Unexpected token '<'` typically occurs when the browser tries to interpret an HTML file as JavaScript. This happens when the index.js file is not being served correctly, and the browser ends up loading the `index.html` file instead of the JavaScript file.

To fix this issue, you need to serve the files using a local development server that supports ES modules. Let me set up a development server for you using `http-server`.

### Steps:
1. Install `http-server` globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

2. Start the server in the project directory:
   ```bash
   http-server /Users/spartan/assistant-to-the-assistant -c-1
   ```

3. Open the URL provided by `http-server` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`) in your browser.

Would you like me to run the commands for you?

siddharthck: i can not do this in production . 

GitHub Copilot: If you cannot use a local development server in production, you need to bundle your React application into a single JavaScript file that browsers can understand. This can be done using a tool like **Webpack** or **Vite**.

Here’s how you can set up a production-ready build process:

---

### **Steps to Bundle the React App**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install `webpack`, `webpack-cli`, `babel-loader`, `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-react`, and `@babel/preset-env`:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-env
     ```

2. **Create a `webpack.config.js` File**:
   - This file will configure Webpack to bundle your React app.

3. **Update `package.json`**:
   - Add a build script to bundle the app.

4. **Run the Build**:
   - Use the build script to generate a production-ready bundle.

---

Would you like me to set up the Webpack configuration and update your project for production?

siddharthck: yes please

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

Made changes.

The build process failed because the `react` and `react-dom` packages are not installed. Let me install these dependencies for you. The Webpack build process completed successfully, and the production-ready bundle (`bundle.js`) has been generated in the dist folder. You can now use this bundled file in production.

To integrate it:
1. Update the `<script>` tag in `index.html` to reference the bundled file:
   ```html
   <script src="../dist/bundle.js"></script>
   ```

Let me know if you'd like me to make this change or assist further!

siddharthck: bundle.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: o.render is not a function
    at bundle.js:2:11404
    at bundle.js:2:11469

GitHub Copilot: The error `o.render is not a function` occurs because the `react-dom` package has been updated, and the `render` method is no longer directly available in the way it was used. Starting with React 18, you need to use the `createRoot` API from `react-dom/client` instead of `react-dom`.

Let me update your `index.js` file to use the correct API. 
````

Made changes.


````

````


Made changes.

The `index.js` file has been updated to use the `createRoot` API from `react-dom/client`, which is required for React 18. This should resolve the `o.render is not a function` error. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

siddharthck: do i need to npm run build ?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you need to run `npm run build` again to regenerate the `bundle.js` file with the updated `index.js` changes. Let me know if you'd like me to run the command for you.

siddharthck: landing page : 
   check user settings file exists and complete . if not ask for a user_settings form which is mentioned above. 
   submit button which will store/ update existing local storage file user_settings.json

   rooms_setting check box forms: use rooms.json and update local file accordingly with a submit button.

   and a button "take me to the dashboard" which will take user to the dashboard page. we want to pass a time range while calling dashbaord page . this time range would be current day and hr:min from to rannge calculated with help of shift timings.

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

The `LandingPage` component has been created. It includes:
1. A form to input user settings (name, email, description).
2. A section to select "Rooms of Concern" using checkboxes.
3. A "Save Settings" button to store the settings in local storage.
4. A "Take me to the Dashboard" button to navigate to the dashboard with the appropriate time range.

Let me know if you'd like to integrate this component into your app or make further adjustments!

siddharthck: where you have used this landing page ?

GitHub Copilot: The `LandingPage` component has been created but has not yet been integrated into the application. It needs to be imported and used in the main `App.js` file to display it as part of the application flow.

Would you like me to integrate the `LandingPage` component into your app?

siddharthck: yes

GitHub Copilot: 
````

````


Made changes.

The `LandingPage` component has been integrated into the `App` component. The app now toggles between the `LandingPage` and Dashboard based on user interaction. Let me know if you need further assistance!

➜  assistant-to-the-assistant

GitHub Copilot: The error occurs because Webpack cannot resolve the `rooms.json` file. JSON files are not automatically resolved by Webpack unless explicitly configured.

To fix this issue, you need to:
1. Ensure the `rooms.json` file exists in the root directory.
2. Update the Webpack configuration to handle `.json` files.

Let me check if the `rooms.json` file exists and update the Webpack configuration if necessary. The `rooms.json` file does not exist in the project directory. You need to create this file with the required room data.

Let me create a `rooms.json` file with a sample structure for you. 

Made changes.

The rooms.json file has been created with a sample structure. This should resolve the issue with the missing file. You can now re-run the Webpack build process using `npm run build`. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

webpack 5.99.8 compiled with 2 errors in 2029 ms

GitHub Copilot: The errors indicate that Webpack cannot resolve the paths for `../utils/storage` and rooms.json in the `LandingPage.js` file. This is likely due to incorrect relative paths.

### Fixes:
1. **Update the import path for `storage.js`**:
   - The correct path should be `../../utils/storage`.

2. **Update the import path for rooms.json**:
   - The correct path should be rooms.json.

Let me update the `LandingPage.js` file to fix these issues.

GitHub Copilot: The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` occurs because the rooms.json file is being accessed, but the `rooms` property or its structure is not as expected. This could happen if the rooms.json file is not properly loaded or if the structure of the file is different from what the code expects.

### Steps to Fix:
1. **Verify the rooms.json File**:
   - Ensure that the rooms.json file exists and has the correct structure.
   - The `rooms` property in each category should be an array.

2. **Add a Fallback in the Code**:
   - Update the `LandingPage` component to handle cases where `rooms` or its properties are undefined.

Let me update the `LandingPage` component to add a fallback for undefined `rooms`.

### Steps to Fix:
1. **Validate the Response from `fetchEventList`**:
   - Ensure that the response from `fetchEventList` is an array before attempting to process it.

2. **Add Error Handling**:

GitHub Copilot: The error persists because the `fetchEventList` function might still be returning a value that is not iterable. This could happen if the API response is not in the expected format or if there is an issue with the rooms.json data.

### Steps to Debug and Fix:
1. **Log the Response**:
   - Add a `console.log` to inspect the response from `fetchEventList`.

2. **Validate the Response**:
   - Ensure that the response is an array before processing it.

GitHub Copilot: The error persists because the `eventIds` parameter in the `fetchEventList` function is likely undefined or not an array, causing the `.forEach` method to fail. This issue arises from how the `eventIds` are being passed to the function.

### Steps to Fix:
1. **Validate `eventIds`**:
   - Ensure that `eventIds` is always an array before calling `.forEach`.

2. **Provide a Default Value**:
   - Add a default empty array for `eventIds` in the `fetchEventList` function.

Let me update the `fetchEventList` function to fix this issue.

siddharthck: while making the api requests, I am not sure how is authentication is handled ?

GitHub Copilot: Authentication for the API requests is likely handled via cookies or session tokens, as is common with web applications. Since you are making requests to the same domain (`https://booking.sjlibrary.org`), the browser should automatically include cookies in the requests if you are logged in.

### Steps to Verify Authentication:
1. **Check for Cookies**:
   - Open the browser's developer tools.
   - Go to the "Application" tab and look under "Cookies" for the domain `https://booking.sjlibrary.org`.
   - Look for session-related cookies (e.g., `sessionid`, `auth_token`, etc.).

2. **Inspect Network Requests**:
   - In the "Network" tab of the developer tools, inspect the headers of a successful request made by the website.
   - Look for cookies or authorization headers being sent.

3. **Test API Requests**:
   - If cookies are being used, your fetch requests should work as long as you are logged in.
   - If an authorization header is required, you will need to include it in your requests.

Would you like me to guide you through inspecting the network requests or add debugging logs to check for authentication issues?

siddharthck: can you try the following ? 
LibCal uses session cookies for authentication.

Once you're logged in on the site, every fetch or XHR from the browser includes those cookies.

To make programmatic fetch() calls inside a Chrome Extension and reuse these cookies:

You must run the request from a content script or with credentials: 'include'

The user must already be logged in to LibCal



GitHub Copilot: 
````

````


Made changes.

I have updated the `fetch` requests in the api.js file to include `credentials: 'include'`. This ensures that session cookies are sent with the requests for authentication. Please test the application again and let me know if it resolves the issue!

Response

GitHub Copilot: Summarized conversation historyThe `403 Forbidden` response indicates that the server is rejecting the request due to authentication or permission issues. Here are some steps to resolve this:

### Steps to Debug and Fix:
1. **Verify Authentication Requirements**:
   - Check if the API requires additional headers, such as an `Authorization` token or a specific `Cookie`.
   - Ensure the user is logged in to the system and that session cookies are being sent with the request.

2. **Inspect Network Requests**:
   - Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the network requests made by the LibCal system when fetching event data.
   - Look for any additional headers or parameters that are being sent.

3. **Update API Request**:
   - If additional headers or tokens are required, include them in the `fetch` request.

4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
   - Add error handling to display user-friendly messages when a `403 Forbidden` response is received.

Let me inspect the manifest.json file to ensure the extension has the necessary permissions to make authenticated requests. Summarized conversation historyThe `403 Forbidden` response indicates that the server is rejecting the request due to insufficient authentication or missing permissions. To debug and resolve this issue, we need to:

1. **Inspect Required Headers**:
   - Check if the API requires additional headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `X-CSRF-Token`, etc.).
   - Analyze the network requests made by the LibCal web interface to identify any missing headers or parameters.

2. **Verify Session Cookies**:
   - Ensure that the session cookies are being sent correctly with the `credentials: 'include'` option.
   - Confirm that the user is authenticated in the browser session.

3. **Update API Request**:
   - Add any missing headers or parameters identified during the inspection.

4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
   - Add user-friendly error messages for `403 Forbidden` responses.

Let me start by inspecting the network requests made by the LibCal web interface to identify any missing details. The last command run was `npm run build`, which successfully compiled the project. To debug the authentication issue, we need to inspect the network requests made by the LibCal web interface. This requires analyzing the headers, cookies, and parameters sent during a successful request.

Please open the LibCal web interface in your browser, log in, and use the browser's developer tools (Network tab) to capture the request details for fetching events. Look for:
- Headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `X-CSRF-Token`, etc.)
- Cookies
- Query parameters

Once you have this information, share the relevant details so we can update the `fetchEventList` function accordingly.

siddharthck: we need to use content.js 
Use Content Scripts
Since you're injecting into https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*, this is the most secure and simplest solution.

json
Copy
Edit
"content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": ["https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*"],
    "js": ["content.js"]
  }
]
And in content.js:

js
Copy
Edit
xt — session cookies work automatically
async function getBookingDetails(bookId) {
  const url = `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/admin/equipment/ajax/viewbooking/panel?bookId=${bookId}&groupType=2&from=calendar`;
  const res = await fetch(url, {
    credentials: 'include',
    headers: {
      'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
    },
  });
  const html = await res.text();
  return html;
}
Then you can postMessage the result to your popup if needed.

would this work /

GitHub Copilot: Yes, this approach would work and is a secure and straightforward solution for interacting with the `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*` domain. Here's why:

1. **Content Scripts**:
   - By specifying the `content_scripts` in the manifest.json, the content.js script will automatically be injected into pages matching the `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*` pattern.
   - This allows the script to run in the context of the page, inheriting the session cookies and other authentication details.

2. **Session Cookies**:
   - Using `credentials: 'include'` ensures that session cookies are sent with the request, which is necessary for authenticated API calls.

3. **Custom Headers**:
   - Adding the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header mimics an AJAX request, which some servers require to differentiate between browser and non-browser requests.

4. **Communication with Popup**:
   - The `postMessage` API can be used to send the fetched data from the content script to the popup or background script.

Let me update the manifest.json and content.js to implement this solution. 
````

````


Made changes.


````

````


Made changes.

The manifest.json has been updated to include the `content_scripts` configuration, and the content.js file now contains the `getBookingDetails` function to fetch booking details and communicate with the popup using `postMessage`.

You can now test the extension to ensure that the content script is correctly injected and the API calls work as expected. Let me know if you encounter any issues!

siddharthck: there is another api list we need to call 

GitHub Copilot: If there is another API endpoint you need to call, please provide the details of the API, such as:
- The endpoint URL.
- The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST).
- Any required headers or parameters.
- The expected response format.

Once I have this information, I can help you implement the new API call in the appropriate file.

siddharthck:   const response = await fetch(`https://booking.sjlibrary.org/admin/spaces/confirmed/list`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    },
    body: formData.toString(),
    credentials: 'include',
  });

GitHub Copilot: It seems you are referencing the existing API call to `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/admin/spaces/confirmed/list`. If you need to add another API call, please provide the details of the new endpoint and its requirements (e.g., URL, method, headers, parameters). 

If the new API call is similar to the one above, I can help you implement it in the api.js file. Let me know the specifics!

siddharthck: call to listapi does not work it gives 403. you will have call this with content.js only

GitHub Copilot: To resolve the `403 Forbidden` issue for the `list` API call, we can move the API request logic to content.js. Since content scripts run in the context of the webpage, they inherit the session cookies and other authentication details required for the request.

Let me update content.js to include the logic for calling the `list` API and handling the response. 
````

````


Made changes.

The `fetchEventList` API call has been moved to content.js. It now runs in the context of the webpage, inheriting session cookies and authentication details. Additionally, it listens for messages from other parts of the extension (e.g., the popup) to trigger the API call and send the response back.

You can now test the functionality by sending a message to the content script with the required parameters. Let me know if you need help with testing or further adjustments!

siddharthck: how do i send message to content script ?

GitHub Copilot: To send a message to the content script, you can use the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` or `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` API from another part of your extension, such as the popup or background script. Here's how you can do it:

### Example from Popup Script (`popup.js`):
```javascript
// Send a message to the content script
document.getElementById('fetchEventsButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  const message = {
    type: 'fetchEventList',
    groupId: '123', // Replace with actual groupId
    eventIds: [], // Replace with actual event IDs if needed
    startDate: '2025-05-01', // Replace with actual start date
    endDate: '2025-05-13', // Replace with actual end date
    daily: false, // Replace with actual value
  };

  chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, (tabs) => {
    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, message, (response) => {
      console.log('Response from content script:', response);
    });
  });
});
```

### Explanation:
1. **Message Structure**:
   - The `message` object contains the `type` and any additional data required by the content script.

2. **Query Active Tab**:
   - Use `chrome.tabs.query` to get the active tab in the current window.

3. **Send Message**:
   - Use `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` to send the message to the content script running in the active tab.

4. **Handle Response**:
   - The content script will process the message and send a response using `sendResponse`. You can handle the response in the callback.

Let me know if you need help integrating this into your popup or background script!

siddharthck: where do i execute this block ?

GitHub Copilot: You should execute the provided block of code in your popup.js file. This is because the popup script is responsible for handling user interactions in the popup UI, such as button clicks, and can send messages to the content script.

Let me update your popup.js file to include the functionality for sending a message to the content script when a button is clicked. 
````

````


Made changes.

I have updated popup.js to include a button click listener for sending a message to the content script. Ensure you have a button with the ID `fetch-events` in your `popup.html` file. Let me know if you need help adding it or testing the functionality!

siddharthck: where should i see the logs for the response ?

GitHub Copilot: You can see the logs for the response in the **DevTools Console** of the active tab where the content script is running. Here's how to access it:

1. **Open DevTools**:
   - Right-click on the webpage where the content script is injected (e.g., `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`).
   - Select **Inspect** to open the browser's Developer Tools.

2. **Go to the Console Tab**:
   - Navigate to the **Console** tab in DevTools.
   - Look for logs from the content script. For example, if you added `console.log` statements in the content script, they will appear here.

3. **Check the Logs**:
   - Look for the response logs from the `fetchEventList` or `getBookingDetails` functions, depending on which API call was triggered.

If you want to see logs from the popup script, open the popup and then inspect it:
1. Right-click on the popup and select **Inspect**.
2. Go to the **Console** tab in the popup's DevTools.

Let me know if you need help debugging!

siddharthck: please add debug logs here

GitHub Copilot: 
````

````


Made changes.

Debug logs have been added to the `fetchEventList` function in content.js. These logs will output:
1. The request parameters being sent.
2. The raw response from the API.
3. The parsed data from the response.

You can view these logs in the **DevTools Console** of the active tab where the content script is running. Let me know if you need further assistance!

siddharthck: i do not see any logs other than this : 
console.log("Assistant to the Assistant content script loaded.");


GitHub Copilot: If you only see the log `console.log("Assistant to the Assistant content script loaded.");`, it means the `fetchEventList` function or the message listener is not being triggered. Here are some steps to debug and resolve the issue:

### 1. **Verify Content Script Injection**
   - Ensure the content script is correctly injected into the target page (`https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`).
   - Check the manifest.json file for the `content_scripts` configuration:
     ```json
     "content_scripts": [
       {
         "matches": ["https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*"],
         "js": ["content.js"]
       }
     ]
     ```
   - If this is correct, reload the extension in Chrome:
     1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
     2. Enable **Developer mode**.
     3. Click **Reload** on your extension.

### 2. **Trigger the `fetchEventList` Function**
   - Ensure the `fetchEventList` function is being called. This happens when a message with `type: 'fetchEventList'` is sent to the content script.
   - Use the following steps to test:
     1. Open the popup.
     2. Click the button that sends the message to the content script (e.g., the button with ID `fetch-events`).

### 3. **Check for Errors**
   - Open the **DevTools Console** for the target page (`https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`).
   - Look for any errors or warnings that might indicate why the `fetchEventList` function is not being triggered.

### 4. **Add Debug Logs to the Popup**
   - Add logs in the popup script (`popup.js`) to confirm the message is being sent:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Sending message to content script:", message);
     ```

### 5. **Manually Test Message Sending**
   - Open the **DevTools Console** for the target page.
   - Manually send a message to the content script:
     ```javascript
     chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
       type: 'fetchEventList',
       groupId: '123',
       eventIds: [],
       startDate: '2025-05-01',
       endDate: '2025-05-13',
       daily: false
     }, (response) => {
       console.log('Response from content script:', response);
     });
     ```

siddharthck: there is no button which sends message to content script. can you tell me if one exists or not ?

GitHub Copilot: It seems there is no button with the ID `fetch-events` in your HTML files. You will need to add a button to your `popup.html` file to send messages to the content script. Let me know if you'd like me to add it for you!

siddharthck: popup.js:6 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')
    at popup.js:6:40

GitHub Copilot: The error indicates that the element with the ID `fetch-events` does not exist in your `popup.html` file. To fix this, you need to add a button with the ID `fetch-events` to your `popup.html`. Let me add it for you.

I have added a button with the ID `fetch-events` to your `popup.html`. This should resolve the error in popup.js. Reload the extension and test the functionality again. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

siddharthck: Response from content script: undefined


GitHub Copilot: The `undefined` response indicates that the content script is not sending a response back to the popup. This could happen if:
1. The `sendResponse` function is not being called in the content script.
2. The `fetchEventList` function is not returning data properly.

Let me add debug logs to the content script's message listener to trace the issue.

Made changes.

I have added debug logs to the content script's message listener to trace:
1. The message received from the popup.
2. The parameters passed to `fetchEventList`.
3. The response being sent back to the popup or any errors encountered.

Reload the extension and test again. Check the **DevTools Console** for the target page (`https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`) to see the logs. Let me know what you observe!

siddharthck: where do i see the logs in content script ?

GitHub Copilot: To see the logs from the content script, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Target Page**:
   - Navigate to the page where the content script is injected (e.g., `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`).

2. **Open DevTools**:
   - Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**.
   - Alternatively, press `Cmd + Option + I` (on macOS) or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (on Windows/Linux) to open the Developer Tools.

3. **Go to the Console Tab**:
   - In the Developer Tools, switch to the **Console** tab.
   - This is where all `console.log` statements from the content script will appear.

4. **Trigger the Content Script**:
   - Perform the action that sends a message to the content script (e.g., clicking the "Fetch Events" button in the popup).
   - Check the console for logs from the content script.

If you still don't see the logs, ensure the content script is correctly injected and the message is being sent. Let me know if you need further assistance!

 Response from content script: undefined popup.js 18
 


GitHub Copilot: The error `Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.` indicates that the content script is not running in the active tab. This could happen for several reasons:

### Possible Causes:
1. **Content Script Not Injected**:
   - The content script may not be injected into the active tab because the URL does not match the `matches` pattern in manifest.json.

2. **Active Tab URL**:
   - The active tab might not be on a page that matches `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`.

3. **Extension Reload**:
   - The extension might not have been reloaded after making changes to the manifest.json or content script.

### Steps to Resolve:
1. **Verify the Active Tab URL**:
   - Ensure the active tab is on a page that matches `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`.

2. **Reload the Extension**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, and click **Reload** for your extension.

3. **Check Content Script Injection**:
   - Open the **DevTools Console** for the target page (`https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`) and look for the log:
     ```
     Assistant to the Assistant content script loaded.
     ```
   - If this log is not present, the content script is not being injected.

4. **Manually Test Message Sending**:
   - Open the **DevTools Console** for the target page and manually send a message to the content script:
     ```javascript

siddharthck: okay. now its working. i am seeing the event list in the logs : 
now, how can i invoke this from dashborad.js ?
for the groups in room, make req for the current day range. add it to the temp list. 
this is how an event from event list looks like : 
barcode
: 
""
bookId
: 
"cs_wxqWYjIk"
email
: 
"lisa.josefik@sjsu.edu"
end
: 
"2025-05-13 16:30:00"
event
: 
null
firstName
: 
"Lisa"
group
: 
"Public Meeting Rooms"
id
: 
75232132
item
: 
"225"
lastName
: 
"Josefik"
location
: 
"King Library Public Meeting Rooms"
nickname
: 
"Team Tuesday SJSU Library"
phoneNumber
: 
""
seat
: 
""
start
: 
"2025-05-13 08:00:00"
status
: 
4

now we need to filter the event list according to the shift timing of the day of the individual 

from : 30 mins - shift start timing to end timing + 30 min :

we have to find event lying in this time range. even if the part of event is lying in this time range, we should have it.
make sure we address user with multilple shifts for the day as well. so it would be an OR operation.

once we have the filtered list of event, 

we should map those with the rooms. you can get this information in rooms.json. for every room in group of rooms, there is "item" key which has to be mapped with room's item. 

which will lead us to making of the event object. 
we should make a call to for every bookId we have, to get the event detail. and later scrape this data to form the detailed event object.  this call returns a html page and we have to process this information by using a parser to make a detailed event object.

such as : function extractEventMetadata(htmlString) {
  const parser = new DOMParser();
  const doc = parser.parseFromString(htmlString, 'text/html');

  function getValueMatchingLabel(labelFragment) {
    const allLabels = Array.from(doc.querySelectorAll('dt'));
    for (const dt of allLabels) {
      if (dt.textContent.toLowerCase().includes(labelFragment.toLowerCase())) {
        return dt.nextElementSibling?.textContent.trim() || '';
      }
    }
    return '';
  }

  const email = getValueMatchingLabel("email");
  const isSJSU = email.toLowerCase().endsWith("@sjsu.edu");

  const mediaNotes = getValueMatchingLabel("media notes");
  const hasMediaNotes = mediaNotes.length > 0;

  const internalNoteRows = doc.querySelectorAll('#notes-table tbody tr');
  const hasInternalNotes = internalNoteRows.length > 0;

  let hybridRaw = getValueMatchingLabel("hybrid");
  let isHybrid = false;
  if (hybridRaw.toLowerCase().startsWith("yes") || hybridRaw.toLowerCase().includes("live zoom")) {
    isHybrid = true;
  } else {
    allback detection
    isHybrid = guessHybridFromMediaServicesOrNickname(doc);
  }

  return {
    isHybrid,
    hasMediaNotes,
    hasInternalNotes,
    isSJSU,
    email,
    mediaNotes
  };
}
but we want to keep the original data as well : so the one event object will look like : 
{
  "id": "cs_wxqWYjIk",
  "title": "Team Tuesday SJSU Library",
  "nickname": "Team Tuesday SJSU Library",
  "email": "lisa.josefik@sjsu.edu",
  "start": "2025-01-14T09:00:00",
  "end": "2025-01-14T12:30:00",
  "room": "225",
  "rawHtml": "<div class='panel' id='panel_container_bookinginfo'>...</div>",
  "parsedFields": {
    "eventDescription": "Actual event time for May's Team Tuesday is 2:00pm - 3:30pm...",
    "mediaServices": "Projector, Laptop and microphone at podium, Wireless microphone",
    "contact": "Lisa Josefik (lisa.josefik@sjsu.edu or ext 8-2107)",
    "internalNotes": [
      "Requesting theater for 75 with catering"
    ]
  },
  "derivedFlags": {
    "isHybrid": true,
    "hasMediaNotes": true,
    "hasInternalNotes": true,

  "lastFetched": "2025-05-13T21:30:00Z"
}

GitHub Copilot: To implement this functionality in `Dashboard.js`, we need to break it down into the following steps:

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Fetch Events for the Current Day**:
   - Use the `fetchEventList` function in content.js to fetch events for the current day for all groups in the user's room list.

2. **Filter Events by Shift Timing**:
   - Filter the fetched events based on the user's shift timings for the day. Include events that overlap with the shift timings (even partially).

3. **Map Events to Rooms**:
   - Use rooms.json to map the `item` field of each event to the corresponding room.

4. **Fetch Event Details**:
   - For each event, make a call to fetch the event details using the `bookId` and parse the returned HTML to extract metadata.

5. **Construct the Event Object**:
   - Combine the original event data, parsed metadata, and derived flags into a single event object.

6. **Update the Dashboard**:
   - Display the filtered and enriched event list on the dashboard.

---

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Add a Function to Fetch and Process Events**:
   - Create a function in `Dashboard.js` to handle fetching, filtering, and processing events.

2. **Use `fetchEventList`**:
   - Send a message to the content script to fetch events for the current day.

3. **Filter Events**:
   - Filter events based on the user's shift timings.

4. **Fetch Event Details**:
   - Use `fetchEventDetails` to fetch and parse event details.

5. **Update State**:
   - Update the state of the Dashboard component with the processed event list.

---

Let me start by implementing the function in `Dashboard.js`. 
````

````


Made changes.

I have implemented the functionality in `Dashboard.js` to fetch, filter, and process events for the current day. The events are displayed on the dashboard with their details, including room mapping and parsed metadata.

You can now test the dashboard to ensure it fetches and displays the events correctly. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further adjustments!

siddharthck: can you give me the code to check that fetching detail is working or not

GitHub Copilot: To check if fetching event details is working, you can add a simple test function in Dashboard.js that fetches the details for a specific `bookId` and logs the result. Here's the code snippet:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  async function testFetchEventDetails() {
    const testBookId = "cs_wxqWYjIk"; // Replace with a valid bookId from your event list
    console.log("Testing fetchEventDetails for bookId:", testBookId);

    try {
      const detailResponse = await fetchEventDetails(testBookId);
      console.log("Fetched event details:", detailResponse);

      const parsedFields = extractEventMetadata(detailResponse);
      console.log("Parsed event metadata:", parsedFields);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching event details:", error);
    }
  }

  testFetchEventDetails();
}, []);
```

### Steps to Use:
1. Add this code snippet inside the Dashboard component, preferably at the end of the `useEffect` hooks.
2. Replace the `testBookId` with a valid `bookId` from your event list.
3. Open the **DevTools Console** in your browser and navigate to the dashboard.
4. Check the logs to see if the event details are fetched and parsed correctly.

    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'getBookingDetails', "cs_n6eGyxUX" }, resolve);
  });
VM65:2 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string

GitHub Copilot: The error `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string` occurs because the `bookId` in the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` call is not properly formatted. Specifically, the `bookId` should be passed as a key-value pair in an object, but in your code, it seems to be missing the key.

Here’s the corrected code:

```javascript
const response = await new Promise((resolve) => {
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'getBookingDetails', bookId: 'cs_n6eGyxUX' }, resolve);
});
```

### Explanation:
- The `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` function expects an object as its first argument.
- The `bookId` should be included as a key-value pair (e.g., `bookId: 'cs_n6eGyxUX'`).

Replace your code with the corrected version and try again. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

index.html:1 Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.

GitHub Copilot: The error `Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.` indicates that the content script is not running in the active tab or the message listener in the content script is not set up to handle the `getBookingDetails` message type.

### Steps to Debug and Resolve:

1. **Verify Content Script Injection**:
   - Ensure the content script (content.js) is injected into the active tab. Open the **DevTools Console** for the active tab and check for the log:
     ```
     Assistant to the Assistant content script loaded.
     ```
   - If this log is not present, the content script is not running. Ensure the `manifest.json` has the correct `content_scripts` configuration:
     ```json
     "content_scripts": [
       {
         "matches": ["https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*"],
         "js": ["content.js"]
       }
     ]
     ```

2. **Check the Message Listener in `content.js`**:
   - Ensure the `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener` in `content.js` is set up to handle the `getBookingDetails` message type. It should look like this:
     ```javascript
     chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
       if (message.type === 'getBookingDetails') {
         getBookingDetails(message.bookId).then(html => {
           sendResponse({ html });
         }).catch(error => {
           console.error("Error fetching booking details:", error);
           sendResponse({ error: error.message });
         });
         return true; // Indicates async response
       }
     });
     ```

3. **Reload the Extension**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, and click **Reload** for your extension.

4. **Verify the Active Tab URL**:
   - Ensure the active tab is on a page that matches the `matches` pattern in `manifest.json` (e.g., `https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*`).

5. **Test the Message**:
   - Open the **DevTools Console** for the active tab and manually send a message to the content script:
     ```javascript
     chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'getBookingDetails', bookId: 'cs_n6eGyxUX' }, (response) => {
       console.log('Response from content script:', response);
     });
     ```

siddharthck: dashboard is opend with this url : chrome-extension://mfijocoplmcigakkipfkiahgepdddoap/dashboard/index.html in next tab

GitHub Copilot: The error `Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.` occurs because the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` call is trying to communicate with a content script, but the content script is not running in the `chrome-extension://` page (your dashboard). Content scripts are only injected into web pages that match the `matches` pattern in manifest.json.

Since the dashboard is a part of your extension and not a web page, you cannot use `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to communicate with a content script. Instead, you should use a **background script** or **service worker** as a mediator.

### Solution: Use the Background Script as a Mediator
You can modify your background.js to handle the `getBookingDetails` message and forward it to the content script running in the appropriate tab.

---

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Update background.js**:
   Add a listener in background.js to handle messages from the dashboard and forward them to the content script.

2. **Modify Dashboard.js**:
   Update the `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` call to communicate with the background script instead of directly with the content script.

---

### Implementation:

#### 1. Update background.js:
Add the following code to handle the `getBookingDetails` message:

```javascript
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.type === 'getBookingDetails') {
    // Find the active tab where the content script is running
    chrome.tabs.query({ url: "https://booking.sjlibrary.org/*" }, (tabs) => {
      if (tabs.length > 0) {
        // Forward the message to the content script
        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, message, sendResponse);
      } else {
        sendResponse({ error: "No active tab with the required URL found." });
      }
    });

    // Return true to indicate async response
    return true;
  }
});
```

---

#### 2. Modify Dashboard.js:
Update the `fetchEventDetails` function to send the message to the background script:

```javascript
async function fetchEventDetails(bookId) {
  const response = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'getBookingDetails', bookId }, resolve);
  });

  if (response.error) {
    console.error("Error fetching booking details:", response.error);
    throw new Error(response.error);
  }

  return response.html;
}
```

---

### Steps to Test:
1. Reload your extension:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, and click **Reload**.

2. Open the dashboard:
   - Navigate to `chrome-extension://mfijocoplmcigakkipfkiahgepdddoap/dashboard/index.html`.

3. Trigger the `fetchEventDetails` function:
   - Check the **DevTools Console** in the dashboard for logs or errors.

```

### Explanation:
- The `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` function expects an object as its first argument.
- The `bookId` should be included as a key-value pair (e.g., `bookId: 'cs_aYdGQ5IX'`).

Replace your code with the corrected version and try again. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

siddharthck: VM62:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: resolve is not defined
    at <anonymous>:1:82

GitHub Copilot: The error `Uncaught ReferenceError: resolve is not defined` occurs because the `resolve` function is not defined in the context where you're calling `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`. This typically happens when you try to use `resolve` outside of a `Promise` constructor.

Here’s the corrected code:

```javascript
const response = await new Promise((resolve) => {
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'getBookingDetails', bookId: 'cs_aYdGQ5IX' }, resolve);
});
console.log('Response:', response);
```

### Explanation:
- The `resolve` function is provided by the `Promise` constructor. It is used to resolve the promise with the value passed to it.
- Ensure that the `new Promise` wrapper is present when using `resolve`.

Replace your code with the corrected version and try again. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

siddharthck: interesting arent we relying on communicating with bsvkground to fetch the event details and event list ? we do not need api.js or could you write the code in this file instead of dashboard.js ?

GitHub Copilot: You're correct that the current implementation relies on communication with the background script to fetch event details and the event list. If you'd like to centralize the logic in api.js, we can move the `fetchEventList` and `fetchEventDetails` logic there, ensuring that Dashboard.js only calls these functions without directly interacting with `chrome.runtime`.

Let me refactor the code to move the communication logic into api.js.

Summarized conversation historyYes, you're correct that the Dashboard.js component is currently relying on the background script to fetch event details and event lists. This communication is facilitated through api.js, which centralizes the logic for making API calls. However, if you'd like to move the logic for fetching event details and event lists directly into api.js and remove the dependency on the background script for these operations, I can refactor the code accordingly.

This would make api.js the sole source of truth for API communication, and Dashboard.js would simply call the functions from api.js without needing to interact with the background script.

Let me refactor api.js to include the logic currently in Dashboard.js for fetching event details and event lists.

Made changes.

The api.js file has been updated to include the logic for fetching event lists and event details directly. This centralizes the API communication logic, simplifying the Dashboard.js component. Let me know if you need further adjustments or testing for these changes!

siddharthck: can you see whats the issue with two 

GitHub Copilot: It seems like you're asking about an issue with two components or files, but your question is incomplete. Could you clarify what specific issue you're referring to? For example:

- Are you encountering an error in Dashboard.js or api.js?
- Is there a problem with the integration between the Dashboard component and the API functions?
- Are you asking about the interaction between the background.js script and the Dashboard component?

Let me know so I can assist you better!

siddharthck: can we add get eventList in the background.js as well ? because our dashboard which is running on another tab needs to make a req with help of content.js. not direct call / we gotta communicate with the help of events. right ? 


GitHub Copilot: Yes, you're absolutely correct. Since the Dashboard component is running in a separate tab and cannot directly access the content.js script, we need to use the background.js script as a mediator. This ensures that the Dashboard can send a message to the background.js, which will then forward the request to the content.js script to fetch the event list.

Let me add the `fetchEventList` handling logic to the background.js file.

Made changes.

The background.js file has been updated to handle `fetchEventList` messages. It now forwards these requests to the content.js script running in the appropriate tab. This ensures proper communication between the Dashboard component and the content.js script. Let me know if you need further assistance!

siddharthck: now that we gotta communicate with the background.js withevents to basically make api calls to the target tab with sjlibrary. we need to update dashborad.js code i guess

Made changes.

The Dashboard.js file has been updated to communicate with background.js for fetching event lists using `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`. This ensures proper communication with the content.js script via the background.js mediator. Let me know if you need further assistance or testing!

siddharthck: can you make this above part as a method just like fetchEventDetails ?

GitHub Copilot:

Made changes.

I have extracted the logic for fetching event lists into a reusable method called `fetchEventListFromBackground`, similar to `fetchEventDetails`. This will make the code more modular and easier to maintain. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

siddharthck: you gotta call this as well instead of the current literal code

GitHub Copilot:

Made changes.

The `loadEvents` function in Dashboard.js now uses the reusable `fetchEventListFromBackground` method instead of the inline logic. This makes the code cleaner and more modular. Let me know if you need further assistance!

siddharthck: time range here is is a terminology used by sjlibrary api. its not student assistant shift range. by default we want to use current date as time range for example of today is 2025/05/13, in api req , 
start: 2025-05-13
end: 2025-05-14

if date here is nil, we call with current date, if specified we use that day as reference and calculate start and end . 

shift timings are going to be used later for filtering the event list.

Made changes.

I added a `getTimeRange` function to calculate the start and end dates for the API request. If no date is provided, it defaults to the current date. The `loadEvents` function now uses this calculated time range for fetching events. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

siddharthck: so the parameter timerange is actually going to be a date. which is going to be used to calculate startdate and enddate. so we can renmae that and if its nil just use today's date

The parameter `timeRange` has been renamed to `selectedDate` in both App.js and `Dashboard.js` to better reflect its purpose. If no date is provided, it defaults to today's date. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
